In this assignment we design and construct a database, with a front end application, that handles university students and courses.
These are our workflow in four distinct parts:

    Construction: create (a prototype of) the database and explore it with queries
    Design: take a step back and redesign the database using more systematic approaches
    Usage: define more constraints and triggers to maintain the database
    Interface: write a wrapper program to permit database access without explicit use of SQL
